      <description>My first emulator project is to write a Gameboy emulator, in C++, and is a project with several stages, so this post will be updated over time as new sections are added.
At the time of writing, I have implemented the Gameboy&amp;rsquo;s CPU, memory bus and instruction set.
Github Repository GitHub - CharlieHart0/GameBoyEmu: A GameBoy emulator
(The project is ongoing, and cannot yet be used as a full emulator)
CPU The most important part of the CPU to be modelled is the set of 8 bit registers, of which there are 8, A,B,C,D,E,F,H and L.</description>

      <description>I recently modded my PS Vita, using HENkaku and Ens≈ç, so that I was able to install unsigned software, and begin exploring the Vita homebrew community, and potentially make my own games/programs for the system!
Disclaimers I do not support pirating games, this project was focused on exploring the Vita system and the homebrew created for it!
I do not claim responsibility for any consequences if you attempt this with your own device, you do so at your own risk and may void the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s warranty!</description>
