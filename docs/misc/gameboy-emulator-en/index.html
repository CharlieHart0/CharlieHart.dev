The GB’s tiling system does not allow direct control of individual pixels, instead tiles are used to display square groups of pixels at certain locations.\nCartridge RAM 0xA000 - 0xBFFF: Some game cartridges come with extra RAM on board, this area maps to this RAM.\nWorking RAM 0xC000 - 0xDFFF: The area of RAM that a game is allowed to use.

  <div class="post-content"><p>My first emulator project is to write a Gameboy emulator, in C++, and is a project with several stages, so this post will be updated over time as new sections are added.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, I have implemented the Gameboy&rsquo;s CPU, memory bus and instruction set.</p>

<h2 id="cpu">CPU<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cpu">#</a></h2>
<p>The most important part of the CPU to be modelled is the set of 8 bit registers, of which there are 8, A,B,C,D,E,F,H and L.</p>
<p>The register F is used as the flag register, and the higher half of this register is used for the carry, half carry, subtraction and zero flag bits respectively, which are used to indicate the result of operations.</p>
<p>The register pairs AF, BC, DE and HL can also be used to store a single 16 bit value, instead of two 8 bit values, and the register pair HL is often used to store 16 bit memory addresses.</p>
<p>Also in the CPU model are the program counter and stack pointer, each of which are 16 bit memory addresses.

<img title="" src="https://imgur.com/oq7Mooa.jpg" alt="">
<p>A table of all 8 bit opcodes.</p>
<p>If the byte 0xCB is used as an instruction byte, then a second table of 255 opcodes is used, where the byte following 0xCB is used. These are referred to as the 16-bit prefixed opcodes, and are mostly bit operations, to make a total of around 500 instructions.</p>
<p>The instructions include the following, and many others:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Addition and subtraction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bitwise AND, OR, XOR and comparison operations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moving values between registers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pushing and Popping the values of 16 bit register pairs to the stack</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Control flow operations such as Jumping based on the value of flags in the flag register</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bit rotations, setting and resetting of bits, and bit swapping.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="memory-map">Memory Map<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#memory-map">#</a></h2>
