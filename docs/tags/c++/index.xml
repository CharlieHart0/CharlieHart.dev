      <title>Realtime Softbody Physics - Postgraduate Dissertation Project</title>

      <description>This project was my postgraduate dissertation project, titled &amp;lsquo;Realtime Soft Body Simulation using a Spring-Mass approach&amp;rsquo;. This post can be considered a condensed summary of the dissertation document, and more detailed information can be found at the following link:
The Dissertation document can be found here
Soft bodies are physically simulated objects capable of deformation - changing shape in response to forces experienced. Most physical objects in computer simulations are rigid bodies, which do not experience deformation, but soft body physics systems are required in order to simulate complex structures in a physically accurate way, such as clothing.</description>

      <title>Descending Dudes - Postgraduate 3D Team Project</title>

      <description>This project was created for my University team project, and is a 3D platformer game, in which the player has to reach the end of an obstacle course and achieve the fastest time they can. We created the game as a team of a few students working as a &amp;lsquo;Mini-Studio&amp;rsquo; at Newcastle University.
Our project was created using our own engine in C++, and was based on the &amp;lsquo;Goat Heist&amp;rsquo; game I created as a previous coursework project; We expanded the codebase significantly, to add a wider range of features to a new game in the engine.</description>

      <title>Creating a Gameboy Emulator - Part 1</title>

      <description>My first emulator project is to write a Gameboy emulator, in C++, and is a large project with several stages, so more posts will be made as new sections are added.
At the time of writing, I have implemented the Gameboy&amp;rsquo;s CPU, memory bus and instruction set.
Update 01/10/2024: Part 2 of this project can be found here.

      <title>Goat Heist - 3D Postgraduate Game</title>

      <description>The Goat Heist game was my coursework for the module &amp;lsquo;Advanced Game Technologies&amp;rsquo;, where we were tasked with creating a simple game in C++. We were given a codebase which handled the graphics portion of the game, but needed to add a physics system, some physics related game mechanics, state based AI and pathfinding.
The required features for the coursework included:
Create a game in which the player must attempt to steal a guarded item from a building inside a voxelised world.</description>
