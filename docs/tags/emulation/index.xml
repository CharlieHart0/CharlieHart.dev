      <description>My first emulator project is to write a Gameboy emulator, in C++, and is a large project with several stages, so more posts will be made as new sections are added.
At the time of writing, I have implemented the Gameboy&amp;rsquo;s CPU, memory bus and instruction set.
Update 01/10/2024: Part 2 of this project can be found here.
