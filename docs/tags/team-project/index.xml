      <description>This project was created for my University team project, and is a 3D platformer game, in which the player has to reach the end of an obstacle course and achieve the fastest time they can. We created the game as a team of a few students working as a &amp;lsquo;Mini-Studio&amp;rsquo; at Newcastle University.
Our project was created using our own engine in C++, and was based on the &amp;lsquo;Goat Heist&amp;rsquo; game I created as a previous coursework project; We expanded the codebase significantly, to add a wider range of features to a new game in the engine.</description>
