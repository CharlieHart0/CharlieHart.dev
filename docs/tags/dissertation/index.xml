      <description>This project was my postgraduate dissertation project, titled &amp;lsquo;Realtime Soft Body Simulation using a Spring-Mass approach&amp;rsquo;. This post can be considered a condensed summary of the dissertation document, and more detailed information can be found at the following link:
The Dissertation document can be found here
Soft bodies are physically simulated objects capable of deformation - changing shape in response to forces experienced. Most physical objects in computer simulations are rigid bodies, which do not experience deformation, but soft body physics systems are required in order to simulate complex structures in a physically accurate way, such as clothing.</description>

      <title>Voxel Rendering and World Generation System - C#</title>

      <description>My undergraduate dissertation project was to create and optimise a voxel based rendering and world generation system. Inspiration for this project was clearly drawn from Minecraft, one of the most popular games of all time, but also from games such as Astroneer - which uses a voxel system at the core of its player destructible world.
I used Unity for this project, and created a voxel rendering system which was able to generate a set of triangular meshes, with the correct textures applied, to represent an inputted three dimensional array of blocks, which had been generated using smooth noise functions.</description>
