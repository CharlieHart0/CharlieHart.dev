      <description>Project Summary The Language Game is a multiple choice quiz game made in Unity, inspired partly by the BBC quiz show &amp;ldquo;Richard Osman&amp;rsquo;s House of Games&amp;rdquo;. In the language round of the show, contestants are presented with a multiple choice question, with both the question and all four answers shown in a random foreign language.
Expanding upon this concept, my game allows the player to also correctly guess the language in which the question is being asked, in order to gain bonus points.</description>
