      <title>Creating a Gameboy Emulator - Ongoing</title>

      <description>My first emulator project is to write a Gameboy emulator, in C++, and is a project with several stages, so this post will be updated over time as new sections are added.
At the time of writing, I have implemented the Gameboy&amp;rsquo;s CPU, memory bus and instruction set.
Github Repository GitHub - CharlieHart0/GameBoyEmu: A GameBoy emulator
(The project is ongoing, and cannot yet be used as a full emulator)
CPU The most important part of the CPU to be modelled is the set of 8 bit registers, of which there are 8, A,B,C,D,E,F,H and L.</description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Charlie, a game developer and student currently in my fourth year at Newcastle University in the UK, where I am studying Computer Science (Games Engineering) at master&amp;rsquo;s level.
Since 2018, I have been developing games both in my spare time and as part of my University course, ranging from small experiments and gamejam projects to larger projects, such as my undergraduate dissertation project.
I have experience in both Unity and Unreal Engine, both in C# and C++, and several of my projects have been created without the use of an engine, in C++.</description>

      <title>Modding the PS Vita</title>
      <link>https://charliehart.dev/misc/vita-hacking-en/</link>

      <description>I recently modded my PS Vita, using HENkaku and Ensō, so that I was able to install unsigned software, and begin exploring the Vita homebrew community, and potentially make my own games/programs for the system!
Disclaimers I do not support pirating games, this project was focused on exploring the Vita system and the homebrew created for it!
I do not claim responsibility for any consequences if you attempt this with your own device, you do so at your own risk and may void the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s warranty!</description>

      <title>Goat Heist</title>
      <link>https://charliehart.dev/3d/goat-game-en/</link>

      <description>The Goat Heist game was my coursework for the module &amp;lsquo;Advanced Game Technologies&amp;rsquo;, where we were tasked with creating a simple game in C++. We were given a codebase which handled the graphics portion of the game, but needed to add a physics system, some physics related game mechanics, state based AI and pathfinding.
The required features for the coursework included:
Create a game in which the player must attempt to steal a guarded item from a building inside a voxelised world.</description>

      <title>Trijam #226 - Paid in Blood</title>
      <link>https://charliehart.dev/2d/trijam-paid-in-blood-en/</link>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;Paid in Blood&amp;rsquo; was my entry to Trijam #226, a game jam with the twist of being given only three hours to create your game! This does not include planning, compiling or uploading your game, only time spent actively creating the game.
The theme for the jam was &amp;lsquo;You gain a little, you lose a little&amp;rsquo;. The idea I settled on for the game was a small roguelite, where the players health is used as a currency to unlock upgrades.</description>

      <title>Voxel Rendering and World Generation System</title>
      <link>https://charliehart.dev/3d/voxel-world-diss-en/</link>

      <guid>https://charliehart.dev/3d/voxel-world-diss-en/</guid>
      <description>My undergraduate dissertation project was to create and optimise a voxel based rendering and world generation system. Inspiration for this project was clearly drawn from Minecraft, one of the most popular games of all time, but also from games such as Astroneer - which uses a voxel system at the core of its player destructible world.
I used Unity for this project, and created a voxel rendering system which was able to generate a set of triangular meshes, with the correct textures applied, to represent an inputted three dimensional array of blocks, which had been generated using smooth noise functions.</description>

      <title>The Language Game</title>
      <link>https://charliehart.dev/2d/language-game-en/</link>

      <description>The Language Game is a multiple choice quiz game made in Unity, inspired partly by the BBC quiz show &amp;ldquo;Richard Osman&amp;rsquo;s House of Games&amp;rdquo;. In the language round of the show, contestants are presented with a multiple choice question, with both the question and all four answers shown in a random foreign language.
Expanding upon this concept, my game allows the player to also correctly guess the language in which the question is being asked, in order to gain bonus points.</description>

      <title>Mini Jam 117- Double-Barrelled Doppelgänger</title>
      <link>https://charliehart.dev/2d/doppelganger-en/</link>

      <description>Double-Barrelled Doppelgänger (DBD) was my entry to Mini Jam 117, a 72 hour gamejam that occurs every two weeks on Itch.io. The theme was &amp;lsquo;Ghosts&amp;rsquo;, as the jam took place in October 2022, near halloween.
The additional limitation for the jam&amp;rsquo;s entries was &amp;lsquo;Shotgun as a Mechanic&amp;rsquo;, and so DBD features a noisemaker toy shotgun as one of it&amp;rsquo;s core mechanics.
