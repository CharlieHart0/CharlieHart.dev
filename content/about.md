Hi! I'm Charlie, a developer and graduate of [Newcastle University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/) in the UK, where I studied [Computer Science (Games Engineering)](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/undergraduate/degrees/i610/) at master's level, graduating with first class honours.

Since 2018, I have been developing games both in my spare time and as part of my University course, ranging from small experiments and [gamejam projects](https://charliehart.dev/tags/game-jam/) to larger projects, such as [my undergraduate dissertation project](https://charliehart.dev/3d/voxel-world-diss-en/).

I have experience in both [Unity](https://charliehart.dev/tags/unity/) and Unreal Engine, both in [C#](https://charliehart.dev/tags/c-sharp/) and [C++](https://charliehart.dev/tags/cpp/), and several of my projects have been created without the use of an engine, in C++. As a versatile developer with a strong foundation in game development, Iâ€™ve honed my skills in solving complex problems, designing systems, and optimizing performance in my projects. 

However, my expertise is not limited to game development -  I have a passion for software development, and [my other projects](https://charliehart.dev/misc/) not directly related to game development show this.

Please take some time to look through my projects and send me an email if you have any queries!
