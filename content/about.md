Hi! I'm Charlie, a game developer and student currently in my fourth year at [Newcastle University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/) in the UK, where I am studying [Computer Science (Games Engineering)](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/undergraduate/degrees/i610/) at master's level.

Since 2018, I have been developing games both in my spare time and as part of my University course, ranging from small experiments and [gamejam projects](https://charliehart.dev/tags/game-jam/) to larger projects, such as [my undergraduate dissertation project](https://charliehart.dev/3d/voxel-world-diss-en/). 

I have experience in both [Unity](https://charliehart.dev/tags/unity/) and Unreal Engine, both in [C#](https://charliehart.dev/tags/c-sharp/) and [C++](https://charliehart.dev/tags/cpp/), and several of my projects have been created without the use of an engine, in C++. My website also features [other projects](https://charliehart.dev/misc/) I've been working on in my spare time not directly related to game development.

You can contact me at charlie@charliehart.dev
