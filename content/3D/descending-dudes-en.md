This project is a 3D platformer game, in which the player has to reach the end of an obstacle course and achieve the fastest time they can. It was created by a team of me and eight other students working as a 'Mini-Studio' at Newcastle University.

Our project was created using our own engine in C++, and was based on [the 'Goat Heist' game](https://charliehart.dev/3d/goat-game-en/) I created as a previous coursework project - we expanded the codebase significantly, to add a wider range of features to a new game in the engine.

## Development

In this section, I'll only cover the areas of the game which I worked on.

### Axial Constraints

### Trigger Volumes

#### Checkpoints and Respawn Triggers

### Rhino Enemy

### Map editor/importer

## Future Work

- Scene nodes and children parent objects

- Physics objects which are static, make physics calculations simpler, currently they are ridigbodies with full constraints applied.

- OBBs are not working correctly
