## Project Summary

This project aimed to programatically solve a puzzle in the video game 'Destiny 2' and was the first program I created in C++ that was not a university project.

The puzzle is presented to the player as follows:

- There are 16 different alien glyphs on the wall in front of the player.

- 16 statements are then made to the player, each of which will show three glyphs, with each glyph either being matched to a triangle or a circle.

- Each of these 16 statements will contain 2 lies and 1 truth.

- The player must then determine the true value assigned to each glyph, either triangle or circle.
